Future checklist:
-
* Create a RootView and (maybe) its view model to hold all of the app's pages. 
* Implement XCTests for unit tests instead of running them manually
* Adjust the views to make them more cross-device compatible
* Look into TabViews to solve the problem of a new home page popping up when I'm already on a home page
* Look into Authentication best practices in Vapor and implementing JWT authentication
* Get hookedup to the mealdb API to get some dummy recipes
